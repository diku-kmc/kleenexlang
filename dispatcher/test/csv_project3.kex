/* CSV project #3
   Project away every column from a CSV file except number 2 and 5 and
   insert a tab symbol between them.
   Requires the CSV file to have exactly six columns.  This makes it easy
   to construct a corresponding regexp in RE2 and compare.  RE2 would not
   be able to handle CSV files with arbitrary column counts.
