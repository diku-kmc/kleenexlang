-- | We want to be able to stop backtracking early by maintaining extra state in
-- the form of a Marks set. Additionally, we only want to be able to update our
-- marks set only when a computation backtracks, and not when it succeeds. To
-- accomplish this, we introduce MarkLists, which are simply regular lists with a
-- Marks set at the end. In the finite case, this is equivalent to ([a], Marks)
-- and hence is not that interesting. However, when we represent MarkLists as
-- diff lists, the representation gets more interesting.
data MarkList a = Nil Marks
                | a :. (MarkList a)
  deriving (Show)
infixr 1 :.

-- | A diff list is a list with a hole in it. For regular lists, diff lists have
-- the type [a] -> [a]. For an example, consider the diff list \x -> 1:2:3:x,
-- which stuffs any x to the end of the list [1,2,3]. Diff lists enjoy constant
-- time append, which makes for an efficient backtracking monad.
--
-- What about MarkLists with holes in them? These are functions such as
-- \l -> 1:2:3:(l m), where m is a Markset. The type becomes

type DiffMarkList a = (Marks -> MarkList a) -> MarkList a

-- | The (Marks -> MarkList a) argument in the type of DiffMarkList can be thought
-- of as a failure continuation. We now have everything needed to define the
-- computation type for our backtracking monad:
newtype Comp s a =
  Comp { unComp :: s -> Marks -> DiffMarkList (a, s) }

-- The following is definitions of various operations for constructing and
-- working with diff mark lists.

{-
-- Not actually used:

dfromList :: ([a], Marks) -> DiffMarkList a
dfromList (xs, m) k = foldr (:.) (k m) xs
-}

dtoMarkList :: DiffMarkList a -> MarkList a
dtoMarkList l = l Nil

dnil :: Marks -> DiffMarkList a
dnil m k = k m

dcons :: a -> DiffMarkList a -> DiffMarkList a
dcons x l k = x :. l k

-- It is inefficient to define a monad instance on Comp directly, since the
-- definition of bind requires us to go back and forth between MarkList and
-- DiffMarkList, defeating the purpose of the latter. We can get a Monad
-- instance via CPS, however, which just requires us to give instances of
-- Computation and Nondet.

-- The type ``CPS (Comp sigma) a'' is equivalent to the type
--    forall b. (a -> Comp sigma b) -> Comp sigma b
-- which is equivalent to
--    forall b. (a -> Input sigma -> Marks -> (Marks -> MarkList b) -> MarkList b)
--              -> Input sigma -> Marks -> (Marks -> MarkList b) -> MarkList b
